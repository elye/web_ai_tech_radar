# Contributing to AI Technology Radar

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the AI Technology Radar project.

## üéØ Ways to Contribute

### 1. Adding New Technologies

The easiest and most valuable contribution is adding new AI technologies to the radar.

**Steps:**
1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to the appropriate quadrant folder
2. Fill in all sections with accurate, concise information
3. Choose the appropriate ring based on maturity and recommendation
4. Add 2-3 high-quality resource links
5. Submit a pull request

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Keep descriptions under 500 words
- Focus on practical, actionable information
- Be objective - avoid marketing language
- Include both benefits AND considerations
- Cite authoritative sources

### 2. Updating Existing Technologies

Technology moves fast! Help keep the radar current by:
- Updating ring placements based on maturity changes
- Adding new resources and links
- Correcting inaccuracies
- Expanding sparse descriptions
- Updating dates

### 3. Improving Documentation

- Fix typos or unclear instructions
- Add examples
- Improve the README or guides
- Create tutorials or videos

### 4. Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a suggestion? [Open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-tech-radar/issues) with:
- Clear description
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Browser/environment details

### 5. Enhancing Features

Before starting work on new features:
1. Check existing issues and PRs
2. Open an issue to discuss your idea
3. Wait for maintainer feedback
4. Submit a PR when approved

## üìù Markdown File Guidelines

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
name: "Technology Name"           # Exact name, with proper capitalization
ring: "adopt"                     # adopt, trial, assess, or hold
quadrant: "techniques"            # matches folder name
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]           # At least 2 relevant tags
date: "2024-10-17"               # ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
featured: false                   # true only for exceptional technologies
---
```

### Content Structure

Every technology should have:

1. **Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What is it?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Why is it significant?

2. **Key Benefits** (3-5 bullet points)
   - Concrete, measurable advantages
   - Focus on user/developer benefits

3. **When to Use** (3-4 use cases)
   - Specific scenarios
   - Context matters

4. **Considerations** (3-4 items)
   - Limitations
   - Challenges
   - Prerequisites
   - Learning curve

5. **Recommended Tools** (Optional)
   - Complementary technologies
   - Integration options

6. **Resources** (2-4 links minimum)
   - Official documentation
   - Tutorials
   - GitHub repositories
   - Research papers

7. **Status** (1-2 sentences)
   - Justify ring placement
   - Current state and trajectory

8. **Last Updated** (ISO date)

### Ring Selection Criteria

**ADOPT** - Use it now
- Widely adopted in production
- Stable and mature
- Strong community support
- Well-documented
- Clear best practices

**TRIAL** - Try it carefully
- Production-ready but newer
- Growing adoption
- Some production case studies
- Active development
- Suitable for new projects

**ASSESS** - Explore and learn
- Promising but early
- Limited production use
- Worth understanding
- May become significant
- Good for R&D projects

**HOLD** - Proceed with caution
- Has significant issues
- Better alternatives exist
- Being phased out
- Not recommended for new work

### Tag Guidelines

Use clear, consistent tags:

**Good tags:**
- `llm`, `deep-learning`, `nlp`
- `python`, `typescript`, `rust`
- `cloud`, `api`, `opensource`
- `production`, `research`, `experimental`

**Avoid:**
- Overly generic tags (`ai`, `ml`)
- Company names as tags (use in content instead)
- Too many tags (3-6 is ideal)

## üîç Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**

   git commit -m "Add: LangGraph to tools quadrant"
   git commit -m "Update: OpenAI API ring from trial to adopt"
   git commit -m "Fix: Typo in RAG description"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin add-technology-name
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request**

## ‚úÖ Validation

Before submitting, run the validator:

```bash
python validate.py
```

All files must pass validation (errors = 0).

Warnings are acceptable but should be minimized.

## üé® Code Style

### JavaScript
