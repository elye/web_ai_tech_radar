# DSPy

## Overview
A framework from Stanford for programming (not prompting) language models, treating prompts as learnable parameters that can be optimized.

## Key Benefits
- Systematic prompt optimization
- Composable LM modules
- Automatic few-shot example selection
- Metric-driven optimization
- Reduces manual prompt engineering

## When to Use
- Complex LLM pipelines
- When you have evaluation metrics
- Research on LLM systems
- Optimizing multi-step reasoning
- Reducing prompt engineering overhead

## Considerations
- Still experimental
- Requires training data
- Learning curve for new paradigm
- Limited production use cases
- Rapidly evolving API

## Recommended Tools
- DSPy library
- Compatible with OpenAI, local models
- Integration with various LLM providers
