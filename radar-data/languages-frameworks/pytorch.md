# PyTorch

## Overview
Facebook's (Meta's) deep learning framework, known for its flexibility, pythonic interface, and dominance in AI research.

## Key Benefits
- Intuitive, pythonic API
- Dynamic computation graphs
- Excellent for research
- Strong community and ecosystem
- TorchScript for production deployment
- Growing industry adoption

## When to Use
- Deep learning research
- Custom model architectures
- NLP and computer vision
- Generative AI models
- Production ML (with TorchServe)

## Considerations
- Steeper learning curve than high-level APIs
- Requires good GPU knowledge
- Memory management important
- Debugging can be challenging

## Recommended Tools
- PyTorch Lightning for structure
- TorchServe for deployment
- Hugging Face Transformers
- torchvision, torchaudio, torchtext
