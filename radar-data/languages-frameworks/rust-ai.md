# Rust for AI

## Overview
Rust is emerging as a compelling choice for AI infrastructure and performance-critical ML components, offering memory safety without garbage collection.

## Key Benefits
- Memory safety without GC
- Excellent performance
- Safe concurrency
- Growing ML ecosystem
- WebAssembly support
- Small binary sizes

## When to Use
- ML infrastructure and tooling
- High-performance inference
- Edge/embedded ML
- ML compilers and runtimes
- WebAssembly ML applications

## Considerations
- Smaller ML ecosystem than Python
- Steeper learning curve
- Fewer pre-built models
- Limited library maturity
- Still evolving for ML use cases

## Recommended Tools
- candle (ML framework)
- burn (deep learning framework)
- onnxruntime-rs
- linfa (traditional ML)

## Resources
- [Rust ML Working Group](https://github.com/rust-ml)
- [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle)
