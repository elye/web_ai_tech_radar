# TensorFlow

## Overview
Google's comprehensive machine learning platform, offering tools for building and deploying ML models at scale.

## Key Benefits
- Production-ready ecosystem
- TensorFlow Lite for mobile/edge
- TensorFlow.js for browser
- Strong deployment tools (TF Serving)
- Keras high-level API
- TPU support

## When to Use
- Production ML deployments
- Mobile/edge ML applications
- Google Cloud ecosystem
- Traditional ML and deep learning
- Large-scale distributed training

## Considerations
- More complex than PyTorch
- Less popular in research community
- API changes in TF 1.x to 2.x
- Debugging can be harder
- PyTorch gaining market share

## Recommended Tools
- Keras for high-level API
- TensorFlow Lite for mobile
- TensorFlow Serving
- TensorBoard for visualization
