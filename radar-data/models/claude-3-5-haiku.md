# Claude 3.5 Haiku

## Overview
Anthropic's fastest and most compact model in the Claude 3.5 family, optimized for speed and cost. Claude 3.5 Haiku delivers impressive capabilities comparable to Claude 3 Opus while being 80% cheaper and significantly faster.

## Key Benefits
- Fastest Claude model with sub-second latency
- 80% lower cost than Claude 3 Opus
- Strong coding and reasoning for a small model
- 200K context window (largest in its class)
- Excellent for real-time applications
- Highly cost-effective at scale
- Native vision capabilities

## When to Use
- Real-time applications requiring low latency
- High-volume use cases where cost matters
- Mobile and edge deployments
- Fast chatbots and assistants
- Document summarization
- Classification and routing tasks
- Supporting LLM orchestration workflows

## Considerations
- Smaller context understanding than larger models
- May struggle with complex multi-step reasoning
- Limited creative capabilities
- Best as starting point before upgrading to larger models
- Trade-off between cost and capability

## Cost
**Paid** - API access required. Input: $0.80/1M tokens, Output: $4/1M tokens. Significantly cheaper than Claude 3.5 Sonnet while maintaining strong performance for many tasks.

## Recommended Tools
- Anthropic API
- LangChain for orchestration
- Claude Console for testing
