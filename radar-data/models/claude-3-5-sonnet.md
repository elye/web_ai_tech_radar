# Claude 3.5 Sonnet

## Overview
Anthropic's most capable model combining intelligence, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Claude 3.5 Sonnet excels at coding, reasoning, and following complex instructions with enhanced agentic capabilities.

## Key Benefits
- Superior coding ability compared to GPT-4o and competitors
- Excellent at following complex, multi-step instructions
- Strong reasoning and analysis capabilities
- 200K context window (largest in production)
- Enhanced agentic workflow support
- Constitutional AI for safer outputs

## When to Use
- Complex coding tasks and software development
- Long-context document analysis (up to 200K tokens)
- Applications requiring nuanced reasoning
- Agentic workflows and tool use
- Safety-critical applications needing aligned AI
- Customer support requiring empathetic responses

## Considerations
- Requires Anthropic API access
- More conservative outputs than some competitors
- Rate limits based on tier
- Newer model family, evolving best practices
- May be more expensive for high-volume use

## Cost
**Paid** - API access required. Input: $3/1M tokens, Output: $15/1M tokens. Free tier available via claude.ai with usage limits.

## Recommended Tools
- Claude Code (VS Code extension)
- Anthropic API SDKs (Python, TypeScript)
- LangChain for orchestration
- Cursor IDE for code assistance
