## Key Features
- **Near-Frontier Intelligence**: Matches Claude Sonnet 4 across reasoning and coding
- **Blazing Speed**: More than twice the speed of Sonnet 4
- **Extended Thinking**: First Haiku with reasoning capabilities and thinking summarization
- **Context Awareness**: Native token budget tracking throughout conversations
- **Cost-Effective**: Near-frontier intelligence at one-third the cost

## Use Cases
- Real-time applications requiring fast responses
- High-volume processing and deployments
- Cost-effective intelligent agents
- Sub-agent architectures in multi-agent systems
- Computer use and browser automation at scale

## Context
- **Context Window**: 200K tokens
- **Pricing**: $1/million input tokens, $5/million output tokens

## Performance
Claude Haiku 4.5 delivers frontier-level performance at unprecedented speed and cost efficiency, making it ideal for production deployments requiring both intelligence and scale.
