## DeepSeek

DeepSeek is an emerging AI research company from China that has gained significant attention for its competitive open-source language models. Their flagship models, particularly DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek Coder, demonstrate strong performance in coding tasks and general reasoning while being more efficient than many Western counterparts.

### Key Features

- **Open Source Models**: DeepSeek releases their models under permissive licenses, enabling commercial use and fine-tuning
- **Mixture-of-Experts Architecture**: DeepSeek-V2 uses MoE architecture for efficient inference and reduced computational costs
- **Strong Coding Capabilities**: DeepSeek Coder models excel at code generation, debugging, and understanding across multiple programming languages
- **Competitive Performance**: Benchmarks show performance competitive with GPT-4 and Claude on many tasks, despite lower training costs
- **Multilingual Support**: Strong capabilities in both English and Chinese languages
- **API Access**: Provides API endpoints for commercial use at competitive pricing

### Use Cases

- **Software Development**: Code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation
- **Technical Q&A**: Answering programming questions and explaining complex technical concepts
- **Code Review**: Automated code analysis and suggestions for improvements
- **Research Applications**: Academic research requiring open model weights for reproducibility
- **Cost-Sensitive Deployments**: Projects requiring powerful LLM capabilities with budget constraints

### Strengths

- **Cost-Effective**: Significantly lower API costs compared to OpenAI and Anthropic models
- **Open Weights**: Full model weights available for self-hosting and customization
- **Efficient Architecture**: MoE design enables faster inference and lower resource requirements
- **Strong STEM Performance**: Particularly excels at mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning
- **Active Development**: Regular model updates and improvements from the research team

### Considerations

- **Newer Ecosystem**: Smaller community and fewer tools compared to OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Documentation**: Some documentation primarily in Chinese, though English support is improving
- **Safety Alignment**: Less extensive red-teaming compared to major Western AI labs
- **Data Privacy**: Data residency considerations for enterprise use cases
- **Availability**: API access may have geographical restrictions or require specific registration

## Assessment Recommendation

**Assess** - DeepSeek represents an interesting alternative in the LLM landscape, particularly for:

1. **Cost-conscious teams** looking for GPT-4 level performance at lower prices
2. **Open-source enthusiasts** wanting full model weights for research or customization
3. **Coding-focused applications** where DeepSeek Coder's specialized training provides advantages
4. **Projects requiring self-hosting** where open weights enable full control

However, teams should carefully evaluate:
- Their comfort level with newer, less battle-tested models
- Data privacy and compliance requirements
- Need for extensive ecosystem tooling and integrations
- Long-term model availability and support commitments

For production use cases, consider starting with pilot projects to assess performance, safety, and operational characteristics before broader adoption.

## Technical Details

- **Architecture**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer
- **Context Window**: Up to 128K tokens (varies by model version)
- **Model Sizes**: Range from 7B to 236B parameters (with ~21B activated per token in MoE)
- **Training**: Trained on diverse multilingual dataset with emphasis on code and STEM content
- **License**: MIT License (varies by model - check specific model documentation)

## Cost

**Free** - DeepSeek models are open-source with weights available for download and self-hosting. The company also provides API access with competitive pricing (paid tier), but the core models are free to use, modify, and deploy.

### Pricing Options

- **Self-Hosting**: Free (model weights downloadable)
- **API Access**: Pay-per-use pricing (significantly cheaper than GPT-4/Claude)
- **No Usage Limits**: When self-hosted on your own infrastructure

## Getting Started

1. **Try the API**: Visit DeepSeek's website for API access and documentation
2. **Download Models**: Access model weights through Hugging Face or official channels
3. **Local Testing**: Use tools like Ollama, LM Studio, or vLLM for local deployment
4. **Integration**: Use OpenAI-compatible API format for easy switching between providers
