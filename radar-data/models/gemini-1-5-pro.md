# Gemini 1.5 Pro

## Overview
Google's advanced multimodal AI model with an unprecedented 2 million token context window. Gemini 1.5 Pro combines strong performance across text, code, image, video, and audio understanding with groundbreaking long-context capabilities.

## Key Benefits
- Massive 2 million token context window (largest available)
- Native multimodal understanding (text, images, video, audio)
- Strong coding and reasoning capabilities
- Competitive performance with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5
- Deep integration with Google's ecosystem
- Cost-effective pricing for long-context use cases

## When to Use
- Processing entire codebases or large document collections
- Multi-hour video analysis and understanding
- Applications requiring massive context retention
- Multimodal applications across Google services
- Cost-sensitive long-context workloads
- Research and analysis of large datasets

## Considerations
- Context window quality degrades at extreme lengths
- Newer model with evolving best practices
- API availability varies by region
- Performance can vary across different modalities
- Less third-party tooling than OpenAI models
- Rate limits on extended context

## Cost
**Freemium** - Free tier: 15 requests/min, 1 million requests/day. Paid tier (Vertex AI): $1.25/1M input tokens, $5/1M output tokens for prompts â‰¤128K tokens.

## Recommended Tools
- Google AI Studio for experimentation
- Vertex AI for production deployment
- LangChain Google integrations
- Official Python/Node.js SDKs

## Status
**Ring: TRIAL** - Production-ready with exceptional long-context capabilities. Worth trying for projects that can benefit from massive context windows or need Google ecosystem integration. Monitor for continued improvements.
