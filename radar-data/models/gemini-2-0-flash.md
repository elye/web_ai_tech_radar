## Overview
Gemini 2.0 Flash is Google's latest multimodal AI model, designed for speed and efficiency. It's the first model in the Gemini 2.0 family, offering twice the speed of 1.5 Pro while delivering improved performance across text, vision, and audio tasks.

## Key Benefits
- Native multimodal support (text, image, audio, video)
- Long context window for complex tasks
- State-of-the-art performance on coding, reasoning, and factuality benchmarks
- Adaptive and budgeted thinking for cost and performance control
- Available via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI

## When to Use
- Building next-generation AI applications requiring advanced reasoning
- Multimodal tasks (combining text, images, audio, etc.)
- Enterprise and research use cases needing high accuracy and reliability
- Scenarios where long context and step-by-step reasoning are critical

## Cost
**Freemium**: Free tier available via Google AI Studio with generous rate limits. Paid tier (Vertex AI) offers production-grade SLAs and higher throughput. Pricing varies by usage volume. See official documentation for details.
