# GPT-4o

## Overview
OpenAI's flagship multimodal model with enhanced speed, vision capabilities, and audio understanding. GPT-4o ("o" for "omni") represents a significant leap in real-time processing and cost efficiency compared to GPT-4 Turbo.

## Key Benefits
- Native multimodal understanding (text, vision, audio)
- 2x faster than GPT-4 Turbo with 50% cost reduction
- 128K context window for extensive document analysis
- Superior performance on coding, math, and reasoning tasks
- Real-time voice conversation capabilities

## When to Use
- Production applications requiring high-quality LLM capabilities
- Multimodal applications processing images, audio, and text
- Cost-sensitive deployments needing GPT-4 level quality
- Real-time conversational AI applications
- Complex reasoning and analysis tasks

## Considerations
- Requires OpenAI API access (paid service)
- Rate limits apply based on tier
- Output quality may vary for niche domains
- Vision capabilities have some limitations
- Consider fine-tuning for specialized tasks

## Recommended Tools
- LangChain for application development
- OpenAI Python/Node SDKs for direct integration
- LlamaIndex for RAG implementations
- Cursor/GitHub Copilot for code assistance
