# Llama 3.1 (405B)

## Overview
Meta's largest and most capable open-source LLM with 405 billion parameters. Llama 3.1 offers competitive performance with proprietary models while maintaining full open-source availability and commercial license.

## Key Benefits
- Fully open-source and commercially licensable
- Competitive with GPT-4o and Claude on many benchmarks
- 128K context window
- Available in multiple sizes (8B, 70B, 405B)
- Can be self-hosted for data privacy
- Strong multilingual capabilities
- No vendor lock-in or API dependencies

## When to Use
- Self-hosted deployments for data privacy/compliance
- Cost optimization through self-hosting at scale
- Customization through fine-tuning
- Research and experimentation
- Air-gapped or on-premise requirements
- Building on open-source foundations

## Considerations
- 405B model requires significant compute resources
- Self-hosting complexity and infrastructure costs
- Smaller models (8B, 70B) have capability limitations
- Requires ML engineering expertise for deployment
- Quality may lag proprietary models in some tasks
- Ongoing hosting and maintenance overhead

## Recommended Tools
- vLLM for high-performance serving
- Ollama for local development
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Text Generation Inference (TGI)
- LangChain for application development
- Replicate or Together AI for hosted inference
