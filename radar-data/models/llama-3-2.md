# Llama 3.2

## Overview
Meta's latest open-source LLM family featuring multimodal vision capabilities and improved performance across reasoning and coding tasks. Llama 3.2 introduces the 90B model size and adds native vision understanding to the open-source community.

## Key Benefits
- Native multimodal vision capabilities (new feature)
- Improved reasoning and coding performance
- Fully open-source and commercially licensable
- Available in 1B, 3B, 8B, 70B, and 90B sizes
- Competitive with larger proprietary models
- Self-hosted for complete data privacy
- Strong multilingual support
- Efficient inference with smaller sizes

## When to Use
- Vision understanding tasks on open models
- Self-hosted deployments requiring multimodal AI
- Cost optimization through self-hosting
- Fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks
- Mobile and edge deployments (1B/3B)
- Building privacy-first applications
- Research and experimentation

## Considerations
- 90B model requires significant compute resources
- Vision capabilities newer than text-focused models
- Smaller sizes (1B/3B) have capability limitations
- Requires ML infrastructure for deployment
- Self-hosting complexity and operational costs
- Vision performance lags behind GPT-4V/Claude

## Cost
**Free** - Fully open-source with no licensing fees. Self-hosting costs vary: 1B/3B on laptops, 8B on consumer GPUs, 70B/90B on server GPUs. Hosted inference via providers: ~$0.10-$3/1M tokens depending on size and provider.

## Recommended Tools
- Ollama for easy local deployment
- vLLM for high-performance serving
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Text Generation Inference (TGI)
- LangChain for application development
