# Mistral Large 2

## Overview
Mistral AI's flagship 123B parameter model offering strong performance with European data privacy compliance. Mistral Large 2 provides competitive capabilities at a compelling price point with both API and self-hosted options.

## Key Benefits
- Competitive performance with lower cost
- European company with EU data residency options
- Available via API and self-hosted
- Strong multilingual capabilities (especially European languages)
- 128K context window
- Excellent code generation abilities
- Function calling and tool use support

## When to Use
- EU data residency requirements
- Cost-sensitive applications not needing absolute top-tier
- Multilingual European applications
- Code generation tasks
- Self-hosted deployments (smaller than Llama 405B)
- Supporting European AI ecosystem

## Considerations
- Smaller ecosystem than OpenAI/Anthropic
- Less proven at scale than incumbents
- Smaller company with resource constraints
- API availability varies by region
- Less third-party integration support
- Newer entrant with evolving capabilities

## Cost
**Paid** - API via La Plateforme: ~$2/1M input tokens, ~$6/1M output tokens. Significantly cheaper than GPT-4o/Claude while maintaining competitive quality. Self-hosted option available (weights downloadable) for infrastructure costs only. No free tier.

## Recommended Tools
- Mistral AI Platform (API)
- LangChain integrations
- Official Python SDK
- vLLM for self-hosted serving
- La Plateforme (Mistral's cloud platform)

## Status
**Ring: ASSESS** - Worth exploring for specific use cases (EU compliance, cost optimization, multilingual). Good alternative to major providers but assess for your specific needs. Monitor ecosystem maturity.
