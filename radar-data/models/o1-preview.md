# OpenAI o1-preview

## Overview
OpenAI's breakthrough reasoning model designed to "think" before responding. o1-preview uses extended chain-of-thought reasoning internally to solve complex problems in science, mathematics, and coding, achieving PhD-level performance on many benchmarks.

## Key Benefits
- Revolutionary reasoning capabilities via internal chain-of-thought
- Exceptional performance on complex math, science, and coding
- PhD-level scores on challenging benchmarks
- Self-verification and error correction
- Breakthrough results on competition-level problems
- Handles multi-step reasoning better than previous models

## When to Use
- Complex mathematical problems
- Scientific research and analysis
- Difficult coding challenges
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Competitive programming problems
- Tasks requiring deep logical thinking

## Considerations
- Significantly slower than GPT-4o (extended thinking time)
- Much more expensive per token
- Preview/research phase - evolving capabilities
- No streaming or many standard API features
- Not suitable for real-time or simple tasks
- Overkill for straightforward queries
- Limited context window compared to GPT-4o

## Recommended Tools
- OpenAI API (direct integration)
- Best used for specific complex reasoning tasks
- Not yet widely integrated in third-party tools

- [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

## Status
**Ring: ASSESS** - Groundbreaking for specific complex reasoning tasks but preview quality with limitations. Worth exploring for hard problems in math, science, and coding. Not suitable as general-purpose model. Monitor for evolution to full release.
