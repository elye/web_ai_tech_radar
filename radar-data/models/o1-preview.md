# OpenAI o1-preview (Superseded by o1)

## Overview
**This model has been superseded by o1 (full production release).** o1-preview was OpenAI's initial preview reasoning model. The full o1 release offers improved performance and is now recommended. See `o1.md` for the current recommendation.

## Key Benefits
- Revolutionary reasoning capabilities via internal chain-of-thought
- Exceptional performance on complex math, science, and coding
- PhD-level scores on challenging benchmarks
- Self-verification and error correction
- Breakthrough results on competition-level problems
- Handles multi-step reasoning better than previous models

## When to Use
- Complex mathematical problems
- Scientific research and analysis
- Difficult coding challenges
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Competitive programming problems
- Tasks requiring deep logical thinking

## Considerations
- Significantly slower than GPT-4o (extended thinking time)
- Much more expensive per token
- Preview/research phase - evolving capabilities
- No streaming or many standard API features
- Not suitable for real-time or simple tasks
- Overkill for straightforward queries
- Limited context window compared to GPT-4o

## Cost
**Paid** - OpenAI API only: $15/1M input tokens, $60/1M output tokens. 6x more expensive than GPT-4o due to extended reasoning process. No free tier. Requires OpenAI API subscription with pay-as-you-go billing.

## Recommended Tools
- OpenAI API (direct integration)
- Best used for specific complex reasoning tasks
- Not yet widely integrated in third-party tools

## Resources
- [o1-preview Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1)
- [OpenAI Research on Reasoning](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)
- [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

## Status
**Ring: HOLD** - Superseded by o1. The preview model is no longer recommended for new projects. Use o1 instead for production reasoning tasks. o1-preview may be deprecated by OpenAI in the future.

## Migration Path
If using o1-preview, migrate to **o1** for:
- Better performance and reliability
- Production-grade support
- Improved reasoning and verification
- Same pricing structure but better value
