# OpenAI o1

## Overview
OpenAI's full production release of their revolutionary reasoning model family. o1 represents a paradigm shift in LLM capabilities, using extended chain-of-thought reasoning to solve complex problems in science, mathematics, coding, and logic with superhuman performance.

## Key Benefits
- Revolutionary reasoning capabilities via extended thinking
- Superhuman performance on complex math, science, coding benchmarks
- Self-verification and error correction during reasoning
- Breakthrough results on competition-level problems
- Full production support and reliability
- Handles multi-step reasoning superior to all alternatives
- Improved from o1-preview with better performance

## When to Use
- Complex mathematical problem solving
- Scientific research and analysis
- Difficult coding challenges and refactoring
- Multi-step logical reasoning
- Competitive programming problems
- Research paper analysis and generation
- Tasks requiring deep logical thinking

## Considerations
- Significantly slower than GPT-4o (extended thinking time)
- Expensive compared to other models (~60x more than GPT-4o for output)
- Designed for complex reasoning, overkill for simple tasks
- Not suitable for real-time or streaming applications
- Limited context window (128K)
- No vision capabilities in this release
- Best used selectively for high-value reasoning tasks

## Cost
**Paid** - OpenAI API only: $15/1M input tokens, $60/1M output tokens for completion (extended thinking billed at 100x). Significantly more expensive than GPT-4o due to extended reasoning. Requires OpenAI API subscription.

## Recommended Tools
- OpenAI API (direct integration)
- Best used for specific complex reasoning tasks
- LangChain integration available
- Pair with GPT-4o for mixed workloads

- [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

## Status
**Ring: TRIAL** - Production-ready reasoning breakthrough. Recommended for hard problems in math, science, and coding where standard LLMs fail. Use selectively due to cost and latency. Monitor for continued improvements and capability expansion (vision, etc.).
