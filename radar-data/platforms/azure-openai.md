# Azure OpenAI

## Overview
Microsoft Azure's implementation of OpenAI models, providing enterprise-grade security, compliance, and regional availability.

## Key Benefits
- Enterprise SLAs and support
- Data residency and compliance
- Private networking options
- Azure ecosystem integration
- Same models as OpenAI
- Fine-tuning capabilities

## When to Use
- Enterprise deployments
- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Existing Azure infrastructure
- Need for private endpoints
- Government and regulated industries

## Considerations
- Application process required
- Limited model selection vs OpenAI
- Region-specific availability
- Higher base costs
- More complex setup

## Cost
**Paid** - Azure consumption-based pricing: GPT-4o $2.50-$10/1M tokens, GPT-4o-mini $0.15-$0.60/1M tokens. Similar to OpenAI API pricing but with enterprise support included. Requires Azure subscription. Pricing varies by region and commitment level (pay-as-you-go vs provisioned throughput). No free tier.

## Recommended Tools
- Azure OpenAI Studio
- Azure SDKs
- Azure AI Content Safety
