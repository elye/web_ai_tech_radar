# Replicate

## Overview
Cloud platform for running machine learning models via API, with a focus on making open-source models easily accessible and deployable.

## Key Benefits
- Run open-source models via API
- No infrastructure management
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Wide model selection
- Easy custom model deployment
- Simple API interface

## When to Use
- Experimenting with open-source models
- Image/video generation (Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- Custom model deployment
- Cost-effective inference
- Rapid prototyping

## Considerations
- Limited enterprise features
- Cold start latency
- Less robust than major cloud providers
- Smaller support organization
- Community model quality varies

## Cost
**Paid** - Pay-per-second pricing: ~$0.0001-$0.001/second depending on GPU type. Llama models ~$0.65-$2.75/1M tokens, SDXL ~$0.0055/image. $1 free credit for new users. No subscription, only pay for actual inference time. Pricing varies widely by model and hardware requirements.

## Recommended Tools
- Replicate API
- Replicate Python/Node.js clients
- Model fine-tuning
