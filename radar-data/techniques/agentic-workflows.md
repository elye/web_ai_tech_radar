# Agentic Workflows

## Overview
AI systems that can autonomously plan, execute, and iterate on tasks using multiple tools and reasoning steps, operating with minimal human intervention.

## Key Benefits
- Autonomous task completion
- Complex problem-solving capabilities
- Tool integration and orchestration
- Adaptive to changing requirements

## When to Use
- Multi-step complex tasks
- Research and analysis workflows
- Customer service automation
- Data processing pipelines

## Considerations
- Unpredictable behavior patterns
- Higher costs due to multiple LLM calls
- Error propagation across steps
- Requires careful guardrails
- Still emerging best practices

## Cost
**Free** - Core agentic frameworks are open-source (LangChain Agents, AutoGPT, CrewAI). Actual costs come from underlying LLM API calls, which can be significantâ€”agents often make 10-50+ API calls per task. Budget accordingly for multi-step reasoning workflows.

## Recommended Tools
- AutoGPT
- LangChain Agents
- CrewAI
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel

## Resources
- [LangChain Agents Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/)
- [AutoGPT GitHub](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)

## Status
**Ring: ASSESS** - Promising but still maturing, monitor developments closely
