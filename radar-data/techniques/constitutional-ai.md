# Constitutional AI

## Overview
A method for training AI systems to be harmless and helpful by having them critique and revise their own outputs according to a set of principles (a "constitution").

## Key Benefits
- Improved safety and alignment
- Reduced harmful outputs
- Transparent value alignment
- Self-correction capabilities

## When to Use
- High-stakes applications
- Public-facing AI systems
- Content moderation
- Safety-critical deployments

## Considerations
- Limited tooling available
- Primarily research-stage
- Constitution design is challenging
- May reduce model capabilities in some areas

## Cost
**Free** - Constitutional AI as a technique is free to apply conceptually. Implementation requires model training costs (GPU compute, data annotation). Most practical approach: use Claude (built with Constitutional AI) at standard API rates ($3-$15/1M tokens). Custom implementation requires research budget.

## Recommended Tools
- Anthropic Claude (uses Constitutional AI)
- Research implementations
- Custom fine-tuning with constitutional principles

## Status
**Ring: ASSESS** - Important for safety, but still emerging
