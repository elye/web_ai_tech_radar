# Fine-tuning LLMs

## Overview
Adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks or domains by training on custom datasets, enabling specialized behavior and improved performance.

## Key Benefits
- Domain-specific expertise
- Consistent output formatting
- Reduced prompt engineering needs
- Better performance on specialized tasks

## When to Use
- Large datasets available (1000+ examples)
- Consistent formatting requirements
- Domain-specific jargon and knowledge
- Cost optimization for high-volume use cases

## Considerations
- Requires quality training data
- Higher upfront cost and effort
- Risk of overfitting
- Model drift over time
- Ongoing maintenance required

## Cost
**Paid** - Fine-tuning costs vary widely: OpenAI GPT-3.5 ~$0.008/1K training tokens + $0.012/1K inference tokens (2x base rate). GPT-4 fine-tuning more expensive. Hugging Face self-hosted: GPU costs only ($0.50-$5/hour). Open-source models with LoRA/QLoRA most cost-effective for experimentation.

## Recommended Tools
- OpenAI Fine-tuning API
- Hugging Face Trainer
- LoRA and QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning
- Weights & Biases for experiment tracking

## Status
**Ring: TRIAL** - Effective for specific use cases, evaluate cost vs. prompt engineering
