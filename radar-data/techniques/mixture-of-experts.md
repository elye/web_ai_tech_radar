# Mixture of Experts (MoE)

## Overview
A neural network architecture where different "expert" sub-networks specialize in different aspects of the task, with a gating mechanism routing inputs to appropriate experts.

## Key Benefits
- Efficient scaling to larger models
- Specialized expertise per domain
- Reduced computational cost per inference
- Better parameter efficiency

## When to Use
- Very large model deployments
- Multi-domain applications
- When inference efficiency is critical
- Research and experimentation

## Considerations
- Complex training dynamics
- Routing challenges
- Limited production implementations
- Requires significant infrastructure

## Recommended Tools
- Mistral AI's Mixtral model
- Google's Switch Transformers
- DeepSpeed MoE
