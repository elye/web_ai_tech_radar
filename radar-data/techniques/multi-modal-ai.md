# Multi-modal AI

## Overview
AI systems that can process and generate multiple types of data (text, images, audio, video) simultaneously, enabling richer interactions and more comprehensive understanding.

## Key Benefits
- More natural human-computer interaction
- Comprehensive data analysis across modalities
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Richer content generation capabilities

## When to Use
- Document understanding with images and text
- Content creation requiring multiple formats
- Accessibility applications (speech-to-text, image descriptions)
- Visual question answering

## Considerations
- Higher computational costs
- More complex prompt engineering
- Limited model availability
- Quality varies across modalities

## Cost
**Paid** - Multi-modal capabilities typically cost more: GPT-4o with vision $2.50-$10/1M tokens (images count as token equivalents), Claude 3.5 Sonnet $3-$15/1M tokens with vision, DALL-E 3 $0.04-$0.12/image. Whisper API $0.006/minute for audio. Some open-source alternatives available (LLaVA, Stable Diffusion).

## Recommended Tools
- GPT-4 Vision
- Claude 3 with vision
- DALL-E 3 for image generation
- Whisper for audio transcription

## Status
**Ring: TRIAL** - Rapidly maturing, excellent for specific use cases
