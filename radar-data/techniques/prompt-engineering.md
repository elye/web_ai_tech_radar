# Prompt Engineering

## Overview
The practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to elicit desired outputs from Large Language Models, combining art and science to maximize model performance.

## Key Benefits
- Improves accuracy and relevance of LLM outputs
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
- Immediate results without model training
- Enables complex reasoning and task decomposition

## When to Use
- Any LLM-based application
- Task-specific optimization
- Chain-of-thought reasoning requirements
- Few-shot learning scenarios

## Considerations
- Requires understanding of model behavior
- Can be brittle across different models
- May need continuous refinement
- Prompt injection security concerns

## Recommended Tools
- OpenAI Playground
- Anthropic Console
- LangChain PromptTemplate
- Prompt flow tools
