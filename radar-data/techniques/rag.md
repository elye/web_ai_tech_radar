# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview
RAG combines retrieval-based and generative AI models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses by grounding LLM outputs in external knowledge sources.

## Key Benefits
- Reduces hallucinations in LLM outputs
- Enables LLMs to access up-to-date information
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning for domain-specific knowledge
- Provides source attribution and traceability

## When to Use
- Building Q&A systems with enterprise documentation
- Creating chatbots that need current information
- Applications requiring verifiable sources
- Domain-specific AI assistants

## Considerations
- Requires well-organized vector databases
- Query quality affects retrieval accuracy
- Latency considerations with retrieval step
- Cost of embedding generation and vector storage

## Recommended Tools
- LangChain, LlamaIndex
- Vector DBs: Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma
- Embedding models: OpenAI, Cohere, Sentence Transformers

## Status
**Ring: ADOPT** - Production-ready, widely proven, recommended for use
