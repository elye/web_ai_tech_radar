# RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

## Overview
A training technique that uses human feedback to fine-tune AI models, helping them better align with human preferences and values.

## Key Benefits
- Aligns models with human preferences
- Improves output quality and safety
- Enables nuanced behavior shaping
- Proven track record (ChatGPT, Claude)

## When to Use
- Aligning models with specific preferences
- Improving safety and helpfulness
- Reducing harmful or biased outputs
- Creating production-ready assistants

## Considerations
- Requires significant human annotation
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Potential for bias in feedback
- Can introduce new failure modes

## Cost
**Paid** - RLHF is expensive: requires thousands of human annotations (typically $10-$50/hour labor), GPU compute for training ($1,000-$100,000+ depending on scale), and reinforcement learning infrastructure. Most teams use pre-aligned models (GPT-4, Claude) rather than implementing RLHF themselves.

## Recommended Tools
- OpenAI API with RLHF models
- Anthropic Claude
- TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning)
- DeepSpeed Chat
