# Aider

## Overview
AI pair programming tool that runs in your terminal, enabling conversational code changes with git integration. Aider excels at making targeted edits across entire codebases using GPT-4o, Claude, or other LLMs.

## Key Benefits
- Terminal-based workflow integrates with existing tools
- Automatic git commits for all AI changes
- Works with any LLM (GPT-4o, Claude, local models)
- Excellent at large codebase understanding
- Interactive refactoring and code generation
- Strong multi-file editing capabilities
- Open source and actively maintained

## When to Use
- Developers preferring CLI workflows
- Pair programming style code assistance
- Multi-file refactoring and changes
- Teams wanting git-integrated AI coding
- Projects using any LLM provider
- Automated code changes via CLI scripts

## Considerations
- Terminal-based (not IDE-integrated)
- Learning curve for CLI interaction
- Requires LLM API access (costs apply)
- Less real-time than IDE extensions
- Manual context management sometimes needed

## Cost
**Free** - Open-source MIT license, completely free to use. Only costs are LLM API calls: GPT-4o (~$2.50-$10/1M tokens), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (~$3-$15/1M tokens), or use local models (free). Bring your own API key. No subscription or additional fees.

## Recommended Tools
- Works with GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini
