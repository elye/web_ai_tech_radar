# Cline (VS Code Extension)

## Overview
Autonomous coding agent for VS Code (formerly Claude Dev) that can create files, edit code, execute commands, and use browser automation. Cline transforms VS Code into an agentic development environment with human-in-the-loop control.

## Key Benefits
- Autonomous multi-step task execution
- Can run terminal commands and browser automation
- Create, edit, and delete files
- Works with Claude, GPT-4, and other models
- Human approval workflow for safety
- Open source and free
- Active community and development

## When to Use
- Complex multi-step development tasks
- Prototyping and scaffolding new projects
- Repetitive coding tasks requiring automation
- Learning and exploring codebases
- Tasks benefiting from browser interaction
- Developers wanting agentic AI assistance in VS Code

## Considerations
- Autonomous actions require oversight
- Can incur high API costs on complex tasks
- Preview quality - rapidly evolving
- Requires careful prompt engineering
- May make mistakes requiring rollback
- Security implications of command execution

## Cost
**Free** - Open-source VS Code extension, completely free to install and use. Only costs are LLM API calls: bring your own API key for Claude ($3-$15/1M tokens), GPT-4o ($2.50-$10/1M tokens), or use local models (free). Total cost depends on usage complexity.

## Recommended Tools
- VS Code (required)
- Works best with Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o
- Git for version control of changes
