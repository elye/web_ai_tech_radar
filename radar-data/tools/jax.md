# JAX

## Overview
Google's library for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research, combining NumPy with automatic differentiation and JIT compilation.

## Key Benefits
- NumPy-like API
- Automatic differentiation
- JIT compilation for performance
- Easy parallelization
- Functional programming paradigm
- TPU support

## When to Use
- ML research requiring custom gradients
- High-performance numerical computing
- Research on new optimization methods
- Large-scale model training
- When you need full control

## Considerations
- Functional programming style (learning curve)
- Smaller ecosystem than PyTorch/TF
- More low-level than other frameworks
- Debugging can be challenging
- Requires understanding of compilation

## Recommended Tools
- Flax for neural networks
- Optax for optimization
- Haiku for neural networks
- Equinox
