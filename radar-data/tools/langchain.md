# LangChain

## Overview
A framework for developing applications powered by language models, providing composable tools for building LLM-based applications.

## Key Benefits
- Simplifies LLM application development
- Extensive integrations with LLM providers
- Built-in components for common patterns
- Active community and ecosystem
- Support for agents and chains

## When to Use
- Building complex LLM workflows
- Need for multiple tool integrations
- Rapid prototyping of AI applications
- RAG implementations

## Considerations
- Fast-moving API, frequent breaking changes
- Can be overkill for simple use cases
- Learning curve for complex features
- Performance overhead for simple tasks
- Documentation can lag behind releases

## Cost
**Free** - Open-source Apache 2.0 license. LangChain library itself is free. Costs come from: LLM API calls, embedding generation, vector database hosting. Optional paid service: LangSmith for debugging/monitoring ($39-$199+/month for teams).

## Recommended Tools
- LangChain Python library
- LangSmith for debugging
- LangServe for deployment
