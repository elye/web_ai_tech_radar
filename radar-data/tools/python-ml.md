# Python for ML

## Overview
Python has become the de facto standard for machine learning and AI development, with rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

## Key Benefits
- Massive ML/AI library ecosystem
- Easy to learn and read
- Strong community support
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- Integration with all major ML frameworks
- Excellent data manipulation tools

## When to Use
- Machine learning projects
- Data science and analysis
- AI research and development
- Prototyping and production
- Any ML/AI application

## Considerations
- Performance limitations (use compiled extensions)
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- Dependency management complexity
- Type safety requires additional tools

## Cost
**Free** - Python is open-source (PSF License), completely free. All major ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn) are free and open-source. Costs only from: compute resources (GPUs, cloud), API services if used, commercial support if needed.

## Recommended Tools
- NumPy, Pandas for data
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML
- PyTorch, TensorFlow for deep learning
- Poetry/uv for dependency management

## Status
**Ring: ADOPT** - Essential for AI/ML development
