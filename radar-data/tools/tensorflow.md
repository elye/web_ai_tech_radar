# TensorFlow

## Overview
Google's comprehensive machine learning platform, offering tools for building and deploying ML models at scale.

## Key Benefits
- Production-ready ecosystem
- TensorFlow Lite for mobile/edge
- TensorFlow.js for browser
- Strong deployment tools (TF Serving)
- Keras high-level API
- TPU support

## When to Use
- Production ML deployments
- Mobile/edge ML applications
- Google Cloud ecosystem
- Traditional ML and deep learning
- Large-scale distributed training

## Considerations
- More complex than PyTorch
- Less popular in research community
- API changes in TF 1.x to 2.x
- Debugging can be harder
- PyTorch gaining market share

## Cost
**Free** - Fully open-source under Apache 2.0 license. TensorFlow, Keras, TF Lite, TF.js all free. Costs come from compute infrastructure (GPU/TPU), cloud services (GCP TPU ~$1-$8/hour), or hardware purchase. No licensing fees, completely free commercially.

## Recommended Tools
- Keras for high-level API
- TensorFlow Lite for mobile
- TensorFlow Serving
- TensorBoard for visualization

## Resources
- [TensorFlow.org](https://tensorflow.org)
- [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- [Keras Documentation](https://keras.io)

## Status
**Ring: TRIAL** - Still valuable for production, but PyTorch growing
